During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. The final assignment will involve training a multi-million parameter convolutional neural network and applying it on the largest image classification dataset (ImageNet). We will focus on teaching how to set up the problem of image recognition, the learning algorithms (e.g. backpropagation), practical engineering tricks for training and fine-tuning the networks and guide the students through hands-on assignments and a final course project.

This course aims to expose (a) GSB students to deep learning and AI techniques focused on human well-being, and (b) CS students to behavioral science and design thinking, as well as frameworks and research to better understand human well-being and human-centered designs. Students will form cross-disciplinary teams and work on a final project that delves into an industry and proposes a detailed 5-year road map on how that industry might evolve with AI algorithms that focused on human well-being. Course Description: The past decade of machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, video game playing robots, effective web search, and revolutionary drug treatments. While Artificial Intelligence has been impressive in achieving these specific tasks, this does not always correspond to the broader goal of cultivating human well-being. The goal of this class is to bridge the gap between technology and societal objectives: How do we design AI to promote human flourishing? On Day 1, we draw on behavioral research to discuss what makes humans thrive. Behavioral research shows that for people to flourish, they need meaning, which involves an ability to understand and value others, a sense of belonging, and knowledge that they are making a contribution bigger than themselves. The conditions for this occur when people feel they have the resources and insight to establish a sense of meaning for themselves. Students will draw on this research to focus on building AI technology that effectively understands, communicates with, collaborates with and augment people. On days 2-5, leaders across industries (e.g., healthcare, transportation) that fundamentally affect human wellbeing will participate in lightning round exchanges to delve deeply into the challenge of building technology focused on human well-being, followed by interactive discussion with students. On the last day, the four-person cross-disciplinary teams will present their 2 page white paper proposals to invited guests. Of note: this course is entirely about high-level \"programming\" and provides no technical insight on machine learning, data-mining or statistical pattern recognition.", "courseAttributes": "Terms: Win | Units: 2 | Grading: Satisfactory/No Credit", "courseLevel": "Graduate"}, {"courseTitle": "Advanced Reading and Research", "courseNumber": "CS 499:", "courseDescription": "Letter grade only.

Scientists and entrepreneurs develop breakthrough innovations, aided and amplified by financial capital. Meanwhile, the government serves to either subsidize (as in wartime) or stymie (through regulations) technological development. Often, the advances in economic and military might due to technological advances lead to conflicts between competing countries ¿ whether Japan and the U.S. in the 1970s or China and the U.S. today. Within societies, technological innovation drives outcomes like increased life expectancy, wealth inequality, and in rare cases changes to paradigms of daily life. In this discussion-driven course, we will explore the ripple effects that technological developments have had and will continue to have on the geopolitical world stage, focusing on trends we as computer scientists are uniquely positioned to understand and predict the ramifications of.

Specific topics include search, constraint satisfaction, game playing, Markov decision processes, graphical models, machine learning, and logic.

Much progress in this area in recent years has been motivated by algorithmic applications. Mapping complicated metrics of interest to simpler metrics (normed spaces, trees, and so on) gives access to a powerful algorithmic toolkit for approximation algorithms, online algorithms as well as for efficient search and indexing of large data sets. In a different vein, convex relaxations are a useful tool for graph partitioning problems; central to the analysis are metric embedding questions for certainly computationally defined metrics. In this course, we will see several classical and recent results on metric embeddings with a focus on algorithmic applications.
